    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Black beans and rice make a great 30-minute vegetarian meal 
        that's filling, delicious, and cheap! Great as a side dish or 
        in a burrito bowl, too.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Cook the onion and garlic in olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong> and <strong>garlic:</strong>  One 
            chopped onion and two cloves of garlic add bold flavor. </li>
        <li><strong>Rice:</strong> This recipe calls for white rice, 
            but brown rice will also work. </li>
        <li><strong>Broth:</strong> Vegetable broth keeps the dish 
            vegetarian-friendly, but chicken broth will work. </li>
        <li><strong>Beans:</strong> You’ll need about 3 ½ cups of 
            drained black beans.</li>
        <li><strong>Spices:</strong> Season the beans and rice with 
            cumin and cayenne pepper. </li>
    </ul>
