    <h1>Sushi</h1>
    <img src="../../../Pictures/sushi.jpeg" alt="Sushi">
    <p>is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi),
         usually with some sugar and salt, plus a variety of ingredients 
         (ねた, neta), such as vegetables, and any meat, but most commonly 
         seafood (often raw but can be cooked). Styles of sushi and its 
         presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi 
         rice", also referred to as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Japanese rice</li>
        <li>Algae</li>
        <li>Any kind of meat and any vegetables that you want to add</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep all of your ingredients.</strong> First things first, make your 
            sushi rice ideally at least an hour or two in advance so 
            that it has time to cool to room temperature before 
            assembling your rolls. Then go ahead and prep all of your 
            other ingredients so that you can have a nice assembly line 
            ready to go for your rolls.</li>

        <li><strong>Press the rice.</strong> Then, begin your assembly! The first step 
            will be to press the rice onto your sheet of nori in an even 
            layer, leaving a 1-inch empty border of nori at the top.</li>

        <li><strong>Add the fillings.</strong> Next, layer on your fillings horizontally 
            on the rice, side by side, as evenly as possible.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Roll up the sushi.</strong> Lift up the bottom edge of the sushi mat 
            and carefully fold it over the fillings until they are 
            enclosed in a roll, yet still leaving the top 1-inch of the 
            empty nori exposed. Use the sushi mat to squeeze the roll in 
            as tightly as possible. (Although not too tight, as you 
            don’t want all of the fillings to squish out!)  Dip your 
            fingers in the water bowl once more and use them to wet the 
            remaining 1-inch of nori. Then use the sushi mat to finish 
            rolling up the roll until it is completely enclosed, giving 
            it a final squeeze or two once it has been rolled up to be 
            sure that everything is packed in there tightly. Repeat with 
            the remaining ingredients.</li>

        <li><strong>Cut the sushi.</strong> Using a very sharp knife, 
            cut the each sushi roll into 8 equal(ish)-sized pieces on 
            a cutting board. Transfer them to your serving plate.</li>

        <li><strong>Drizzle and garnish.</strong>Drizzle the sushi with 
            the spicy mayo and/or sprinkle with extra toasted sesame seeds.</li>

        <li><strong>Serve.</strong>Serve immediately, along with pickled 
            ginger, wasabi paste, and soy sauce for dipping. And enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
