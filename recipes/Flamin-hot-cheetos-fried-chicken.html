    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This dish was an original idea of Nicole Rusell 
        (<a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/flamin-hot-cheetos-fried-chicken-recipe-8423963">
        the dish is in this page</a>) and he describes it like this: 
        "I made this Flamin' Hot Cheetos fried chicken one day, when I 
        thought, I use Flaminâ€™ Hot Cheetos to bread fried pickles and 
        onion rings, so why not fried chicken? They lose a lot of heat 
        during the process, so don't skip the cayenne pepper."
